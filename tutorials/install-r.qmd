## Step 2: Download RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working with R easier.

-   The **Source** pane is where you can edit and save R or Python scripts or author computational documents like Quarto and R Markdown.

-   The **Console pane** is used to write short interactive R commands.

-   The **Environment** pane displays temporary R objects as created during that R session.

-   The **Output** pane displays the plots, tables, or HTML outputs of executed code along with files saved to disk.

2.  In the console, type: \`\`\`r version
This will display the installed R version.

Try a simple command
```{r}
10 + 10
```
