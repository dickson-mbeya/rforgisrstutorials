    "text": "R data structures\nA data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. Data structures in R programming are tools for holding multiple values. R has six data structures:\n\n1. Vectors\nA vector is an ordered collection of basic data types of a given length. The only key thing here is all the elements of a vector must be of the identical data type e.g homogeneous data structures. Vectors are one-dimensional data structures.\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nx\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\n2. Lists\nA list is a generic object consisting of an ordered collection of objects. Lists are heterogeneous data structures. These are also one-dimensional data structures. A list can be a list of vectors, list of matrices, a list of characters and a list of functions and so on.\n\nstudentName &lt;- c(\"James\", \"John\", \"Mercy\")\nstudentID &lt;- c(2020, 2030, 2040)\nyearOfStudy &lt;- c(1, 2, 2)\n\nmylist &lt;- list(studentName, studentID, yearOfStudy)\nmylist\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"James\" \"John\"  \"Mercy\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 2020 2030 2040\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 1 2 2\n\n\n\n\nTry it yourself\n\nCreate a vector ages containing 18, 25, 30, 45.\nCreate a list person with “name=Alice”, “age=25” and “is_student=TRUE”.\n\n\n# Your code here:\n\n\n3. Data frame\nData frames are generic data objects of R which are used to store the tabular data. Data frames are the foremost popular data objects in R programming because we are comfortable in seeing the data within the tabular form. They are two-dimensional, heterogeneous data structures. These are lists of vectors of equal lengths.\nData frames have the following constraints placed upon them:\n\nA data-frame must have column names and every row should have a unique name.\nEach column must have the identical number of items.\nEach item in a single column must be of the same data type.\nDifferent columns may have different data types.\nTo create a data frame we use the data.frame() function.\nR data structures: vector, matrix, list, data frame\n\n\nstudentName &lt;- c(\"James\", \"John\", \"Mercy\")\nstudentID &lt;- c(2020, 2030, 2040)\nyearOfStudy &lt;- c(1, 2, 2)\n\nmyDataframe &lt;- data.frame(studentName, studentID, yearOfStudy)\nmyDataframe\n\n  studentName studentID yearOfStudy\n1       James      2020           1\n2        John      2030           2\n3       Mercy      2040           2\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it yourself\nCreate a data frame called “students” with two columns: “name = c(”John”, “Jane”, “Mike”)“,”score = c(85, 90, 78)“. Print the data frame.\n\n# Your code here:\n\n\n4. Matrices\nA matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers in rows and columns. In a matrix, as we know rows are the ones that run horizontally and columns are the ones that run vertically. Matrices are two-dimensional, homogeneous data structures.\n\ny &lt;- matrix (\n  c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100),\n  nrow = 3, ncol = 3,\n  byrow = TRUE\n)\n\ny\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   10   20   30\n[2,]   40   50   60\n[3,]   70   80   90\n\n\n\n\n5. Arrays\nArrays are the R data objects which store the data in more than two dimensions. Arrays are n-dimensional data structures. For example, if we create an array of dimensions (2, 3, 3) then it creates 3 rectangular matrices each with 2 rows and 3 columns. They are homogeneous data structures.\n\nmyArray &lt;- array(\n  c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100),\n  dim = c(2, 2, 2)\n)\n\nmyArray\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]   10   30\n[2,]   20   40\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]   50   70\n[2,]   60   80\n\n\n\n\n6. Factors\nFactors are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. They are useful for storing categorical data. They can store both strings and integers. They are useful to categorize unique values in columns like (“TRUE” or “FALSE”) or (“MALE” or “FEMALE”), etc..\nThey are useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.\n\nmyFactor &lt;- factor(c(\"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\"))\nmyFactor\n\n[1] male   female male   female\nLevels: female male\n\n\n\n\n\nData structures example\nImagine that one you are analyzing weather data (amount of rainfall and the magnitude of temperature) recorded at a particular weather station from Monday, 16th March 2024 to Saturday, 21st March 2024. The observations recorded are as follows:\n\nRainfall readings in mm\n\nMonday March 16 2024: 10\nTuesday March 17 2024: 20\nWednesday March 18 2024: 11\nThursday March 19 2024: 30\nFriday March 20 2024: 15\nSaturday March 21 2024: 9\nSunday March 22 2024:10\n\n\n\nTemperature readings in degrees Celsius\n\nMonday March 16 2024: 16\nTuesday March 17 2024: 17\nWednesday March 18 2024: 25\nThursday March 19 2024: 23\nFriday March 20 2024: 17\nSaturday March 21 2024: 27\nSunday March 22 2024: 13\n\n\n\n\nStep one\nTo work with this data in R, firstly create the vectors Rainfall, Temperature and Date\n\nrainfall &lt;- c(10, 20, 11, 30, 15, 9, 10)\n\nmax(rainfall)\n\n[1] 30\n\nmin(rainfall)\n\n[1] 9\n\ntemperature &lt;- c(16, 17, 25, 23, 17, 27, 13)\n\ntemperature\n\n[1] 16 17 25 23 17 27 13\n\nmin(temperature)\n\n[1] 13\n\nday &lt;- c(\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\")\n\nday\n\n[1] \"Monday\"    \"Tuesday\"   \"Wednesday\" \"Thursday\"  \"Friday\"    \"Saturday\" \n[7] \"Sunday\"   \n\ndate &lt;- as.Date(c(\"2024-03-16\", \"2024-03-17\", \"2024-03-18\", \"2024-03-19\", \"2024-03-20\", \"2024-03-21\", \"2024-03-22\"))\n\ndate\n\n[1] \"2024-03-16\" \"2024-03-17\" \"2024-03-18\" \"2024-03-19\" \"2024-03-20\"\n[6] \"2024-03-21\" \"2024-03-22\"\n\nclass(date)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent the data in a Data Frame\n\nmyweather &lt;- data.frame(day,\n                        date,\n                        rainfall,\n                        temperature\n                       )\nmyweather\n\n        day       date rainfall temperature\n1    Monday 2024-03-16       10          16\n2   Tuesday 2024-03-17       20          17\n3 Wednesday 2024-03-18       11          25\n4  Thursday 2024-03-19       30          23\n5    Friday 2024-03-20       15          17\n6  Saturday 2024-03-21        9          27\n7    Sunday 2024-03-22       10          13\n\nhead(myweather)   #shows first 6 rows  \n\n        day       date rainfall temperature\n1    Monday 2024-03-16       10          16\n2   Tuesday 2024-03-17       20          17\n3 Wednesday 2024-03-18       11          25\n4  Thursday 2024-03-19       30          23\n5    Friday 2024-03-20       15          17\n6  Saturday 2024-03-21        9          27\n\nhead(myweather, 3) #shows first 3 rows\n\n        day       date rainfall temperature\n1    Monday 2024-03-16       10          16\n2   Tuesday 2024-03-17       20          17\n3 Wednesday 2024-03-18       11          25\n\n# Sub-setting a data frame\nmyweather[1, 2]  # returns the data frame element for the first row and second column\n\n[1] \"2024-03-16\"\n\nmyweather[ ,1]  # returns data frame elements for first column and all rows\n\n[1] \"Monday\"    \"Tuesday\"   \"Wednesday\" \"Thursday\"  \"Friday\"    \"Saturday\" \n[7] \"Sunday\"   \n\n\nImagine that you want to know for which date the data was collected.

A school would have its spatial data represented as geographic coordinates(latitudes and longitudes) and its attribute data would include name of the school, student enrollment, number of teachers, name of district it is located in etc.\nAttribute queries select geographic features based on their association with attributes (non-spatial data). This is achieved by using conditions such as field names(e.g., ADIMN, NAME), operators (e.g., &lt;, &gt;, =, ==) and values (e.g., Malawi, TRUE, 20000).\n\nafrica #print Africa sf\n\nSimple feature collection with 55 features and 13 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -25.36042 ymin: -46.96575 xmax: 51.41704 ymax: 37.3452\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 10 features:\n                         ADMIN ADM0_A3   POP_EST POP_RANK POP_YEAR GDP_MD\n1                     Ethiopia     ETH 112078730       17     2019  95912\n2                  South Sudan     SDS  11062113       14     2019  11998\n3                      Somalia     SOM  10192317       14     2019   4719\n4                        Kenya     KEN  52573973       16     2019  95503\n5                       Malawi     MWI  18628747       14     2019   7666\n6  United Republic of Tanzania     TZA  58005463       16     2019  63177\n7                   Somaliland     SOL   5096159       13     2014  17836\n8                      Morocco     MAR  36471769       15     2019 119700\n9               Western Sahara     SAH    603253       11     2017    907\n10       Republic of the Congo     COG   5380508       13     2019  12267\n   GDP_YEAR                   ECONOMY             INCOME_GRP CONTINENT\n1      2019 7.
